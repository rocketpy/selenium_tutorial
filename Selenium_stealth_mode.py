A python package selenium-stealth to prevent detection. This programme is trying to make python selenium more stealthy.

As of now selenium-stealth only support Selenium Chrome.

After using selenium-stealth you can prevent almost all selenium detections.
There is a lot of guides on stackoverflow on How to prevent selenium detection but I can not find a single python package
for it so I am just creating one after all we can't let the cats win.
It can be seen as a re-implementation of JavaScript puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth developed by @berstend.

Features that currently selenium-stealth can offer:
✅️ selenium-stealth with stealth passes all public bot tests.

✅️ With selenium-stealth selenium can do google account login.

✅️ selenium-stealth help with maintaining a normal reCAPTCHA v3 score
